# 🤖 MNIST Classification – Educational Deep Learning Project

A hands-on educational project designed and implemented by **Safiah Mohammed Al-Qarni**.  

This project demonstrates **how to classify handwritten digits** from the **MNIST dataset** using **PyTorch**, providing a practical introduction to deep learning concepts and neural network implementation.  

🎯 *The project is ideal for students and beginners in AI to understand the full workflow of a neural network, from data loading to model evaluation.* 💚

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset  
- Build a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model  
- Train the model using backpropagation  
- Evaluate accuracy on test data  
- Visualize sample predictions and plots  

---

## 💡 How It Works
1. Load the MNIST dataset and preprocess the images.  
2. Define a simple MLP neural network architecture.  
3. Train the model on the training dataset.  
4. Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset.  
5. Visualize results including sample predictions and accuracy plots.

## 📊 Expected Results
- **Accuracy:** 95% – 97%  
- **Training Time:** < 1 minute on CPU  
- Example plots of **loss and accuracy over epochs** and sample predictions in `results/`
